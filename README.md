## 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 20+
- npm (or yarn / pnpm)

Check versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate to the project:

```bash
cd proserve-frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.

Example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

> Do not commit `.env.local` to source control.

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Application runs at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🏗️ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## 🧹 Linting

Run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Build the application |
| `npm start` | Run production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

---

## 🌐 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs.

Base URL is configured using:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
```

All API calls should be implemented inside:

```text
src/services/
```

---

## 🎨 UI Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Ant Design components where appropriate.
- Keep components reusable.
- Prefer Server Components unless client-side interactivity is required.
- Use Client Components only when necessary (`'use client'`).

---

## 📂 Coding Standards

### Components

- Use functional components.
- One component per file.
- Keep components focused and reusable.

Example:

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  title: string;
}

export default function Button({ title }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button>{title}</button>;
}
```

### Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention |
|------|------------|
| Components | PascalCase |
| Hooks | camelCase (`useAuth`) |
| Functions | camelCase |
| Variables | camelCase |
| Route folders | kebab-case |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE |

---

## 📋 Form Validation

Use:

- React Hook Form
- Zod

Validation schemas should be stored close to the feature or in a dedicated validation folder.

---

## 🔄 State Management

Use:

- React Query for server state.
- React Context or another approved solution for lightweight global UI state.

Avoid unnecessary global state.

---

## 📁 Import Aliases

Use:

```ts
@/components
@/features
@/hooks
@/services
@/utils
@/types
```

Avoid long relative imports like:

```ts
../../../components/Button
```

---

## 🛠️ Git Workflow

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

Commit changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add login page"
```

Push changes:

```bash
git push origin feature/feature-name
```

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep components small and reusable.
- Avoid duplicated code.
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces.
- Avoid using `any`.
- Handle loading and error states.
- Keep business logic out of UI components.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
